There is an argument from a Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) viewpoint that all URLs in a website should be absolute urls even when they refer to assets on the same site. The reasons relate to the way that search engines crawl sites and the possible duplication of content if two URLs point to the same page (eg. ","position":{"start":{"line":42,"column":65,"offset":7396},"end":{"line":42,"column":559,"offset":7890}}},{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"https://example.org/"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"https://example.org/","position":{"start":{"line":42,"column":559,"offset":7890},"end":{"line":42,"column":579,"offset":7910}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":42,"column":559,"offset":7890},"end":{"line":42,"column":579,"offset":7910}}},{"type":"text","value":" and ","position":{"start":{"line":42,"column":579,"offset":7910},"end":{"line":42,"column":584,"offset":7915}}},{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"http://example.org"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"http://example.org","position":{"start":{"line":42,"column":584,"offset":7915},"end":{"line":42,"column":602,"offset":7933}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":42,"column":584,"offset":7915},"end":{"line":42,"column":602,"offset":7933}}},{"type":"text","value":").","position":{"start":{"line":42,"column":602,"offset":7933},"end":{"line":42,"column":604,"offset":7935}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":42,"column":1,"offset":7332},"end":{"line":42,"column":604,"offset":7935}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"One final form of relative URL looks like this:","position":{"start":{"line":44,"column":1,"offset":7939},"end":{"line":44,"column":48,"offset":7986}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":44,"column":1,"offset":7939},"end":{"line":44,"column":48,"offset":7986}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This URL is only missing the protocol part and is turned into an absolute URL by adding the protocol part of the current page URL.
