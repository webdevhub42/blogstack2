At that time, the returned promise's handler is passed as input an array containing the outcome of each promise in the original set of promises.</p>\n<p>However, <strong>if and only if</strong> an empty iterable is passed as an argument, <code class=\"language-text\">Promise.allSettled()</code> returns a <code class=\"language-text\">Promise</code> object that has <strong>already been resolved</strong> as an empty array.</p>\n<p>For each outcome object, a <code class=\"language-text\">status</code> string is present. If the status is <code class=\"language-text\">fulfilled</code>, then a <code class=\"language-text\">value</code> is present. If the status is <code class=\"language-text\">rejected</code>, then a <code class=\"language-text\">reason</code> is present. The value (or reason) reflects what value each promise was fulfilled (or rejected) with.</p>\n<h2>Examples</h2>\n<h3>Using Promise.allSettled</h3>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">Promise.allSettled([\n  Promise.resolve(33),\n  new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(66), 0)),\n  99,\n  Promise.reject(new Error('an error'))\n])\n.then(values => console.log(values));\n\n// [\n//   {status: \"fulfilled\", value: 33},\n//   {status: \"fulfilled\", value: 66},\n//   {status: \"fulfilled\", value: 99},\n//   {status: \"rejected\",  reason: Error: an error}\n// ]</code></pre></div>"}
